## Anything starting in # will be a comment, and thus ignored by the map.
## Here, we set up some more basic logistics for the map
## The amount of column and rows is maybe not needed, but nice to have
Players = 2
Tileamt = 25
Rows = 5
Cols = 5
## Now, we can outline what the rows will look like, and detail the offsets, from some center point.
## OFFSET IS USELESS, DELETE IT FROM REGEX
M=1; 00000; offset=0
M=2; 11111; offset=-1
M=3; 11111; offset=0
M=4; 11111; offset=-1
M=5; 11111; offset=0
## May or may not need to change the numbers part, we';; see
## Since the tiles need to fit in together.

## With that, we've described the map.
