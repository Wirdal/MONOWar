## Anything starting in # will be a comment, and thus ignored by the map.
## Here, we set up some more basic logistics for the map
## The amount of column and rows is maybe not needed, but nice to have
Tileamt = 25 
Rows = 5
Cols = 5
## Now, we can outline what the rows will look like, and detail the offsets, from some center point.
MapStart
11111; offset=0
11111; offset=-1
11111; offset=0
11111; offset=-1
11111; offset=0
MapEnd
## We've described the mat, and told the game the offset
## the map needs an offset, since it's an hex based map.
## It will look something like this
## 11111
##11111
## 11111
##11111
## 11111
## Since the tiles need to fit in together.
UnitStart
UnitEnd
## With that, we've described the map.
